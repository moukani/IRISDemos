These are small applications built on top of a stack with the objective of demoing specific parts of InterSystems technology. 

Basically, someone would copy and paste a stack folder definition on a demo folder, give it a different name and start changing this template to built its application. 

A README.md file should be provided under each demo folder to explain how to run the demo using the run.sh script.

These demos will be visible only to InterSystems Sales and Partners. They should not include any intellectual property that you are not willing to share.
