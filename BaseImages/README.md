These are very basic images of iris, tomcat, zeppelin, etc. They are cooked to be used by our stacks and demos. 

They should not include any source code specific to any stack or demo. 

A Dockerfile specification should define this basic image. 

Instructions on how to use it and start it should be provided on a README.md file on the image folder.
