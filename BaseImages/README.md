These are images of iris, tomcat, zeppelin, etc. created to support the stacks and demos we are building. They should not include any source code specific to any stack or demo. Each folder must have at least a Dockerfile and a README to explain how to use the image.

Here is the list of current images we have:

* [irisdemodb](./irisdemodb/) - Preconfigured IRIS Database
* [irisdemoint](./irisdemoint/) - Preconfigured IRIS Interoperability
* [zeppelin-spark](./zeppelin-spark/) - Preconfigured Zeppelin notebook image with IRIS connectivity through Spark and JDBC (the Spark cluster is on the Zeppelin image)
