# Default system properties included when running spark-submit.

# This file doesn't not support string expansion so we can use environment
# variables to parameterize it. I want the spark object created by pyspark and 
# zeppelin to be fully configured for our IRIS cluster. I could have created
# a interpreter on zeppelin called irisspark in the same way I did for irisjdbc and
# put these properties there. That would work with zeppelin but not with the 
# pyspark CLI for instance. Configuring these properties here, make them 
# available for both zeppelin and all spark CLI's.
